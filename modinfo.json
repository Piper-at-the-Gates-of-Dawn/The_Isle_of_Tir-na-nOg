	"description": "Still in Beta-test!  let me be clear, this mod is 90% finished - besides bugfixing it is getting polished (meshes in the game do not always look like in the devkit) and populated. I give priority to bugfixing. Getting fairly stable now. \n\nTotal Conan Vanilla map rebuild:\n- many deserts turned into Savannah or even greener\n- The Nameless City is like an overgrown jungle city\n- Map will suggest this land is an Island\n- New areas: in the North East and in the South\n- Designed to work with its sister project: the Underdark\n- Map with 267 regions to support conquest scenarios included\n- the combination of Underdark and the Isle of Tir-na-nOg will about double the playable area\n\nmany thanks to Fluxmaster and the 7th Crest who helped me out!\n\nmod info can be found at: https://discord.gg/cYsQWejJ27\n\n",
