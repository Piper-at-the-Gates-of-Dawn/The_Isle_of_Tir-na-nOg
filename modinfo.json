	"description": "Total Conan Vanilla map rebuild:\n- many deserts turned into Savannah or even greener\n- The Nameless City is like an overgrown jungle city\n- Map will suggest this land is an Island\n- New areas: in the North East and in the South\n- New Asagarth has neutral populace (like in Supermeru)\n- Designed to work with its sister project: the Underdark\n- Map with 267 regions to support conquest scenarios included\n- sun and moon rise in the east\n- admins: at X-292390.0  Y218820.0  Z-24050.0  you can find a hall to set up races and classes like so many servers do nowaydays.  Or you turn it into a small dungeon.\n- the combination of Underdark and the Isle of Tir-na-nOg will about double the playable area\n\nWARNING!  If you run this mod WITHOUT the Underdark-mod, then you will have to seal off the following holes:\n- Kings Niche - there is an opening all the way in the back\n- the Passage, coming from the jungle, the moment you come in the first great cave, turn left, opening is in the bottom\n\nmany thanks to Fluxmaster, without him, this mod would have failed.\n\nmore mod info, and there is a lot, can be found at: https://discord.gg/cYsQWejJ27\n\n",
