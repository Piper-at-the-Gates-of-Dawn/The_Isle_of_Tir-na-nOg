	"description": "Total Conan Vanilla map rebuild:\n- many deserts turned into Savannah or even greener\n- The Nameless City is like an overgrown jungle city\n- Map will suggest this land is an Island\n- New areas: in the North East and in the South\n- New Asagarth has neutral populace (like in Supermeru)\n- Designed to work with its sister project: the Underdark\n- Map with 267 regions to support conquest scenarios included\n- sun and moon rise in the east\n- the combination of Underdark and the Isle of Tir-na-nOg will about double the playable area\n\nWARNING!  If you run this mod WITHOUT the Underdark-mod, then you will have to seal off the following holes:\n- Kings Niche - there is an opening all the way in the back\n- Xalthar's Refuge - opening all the way in the back\n- the Passage, coming from the jungle, the moment you come in the first great cave, turn left, opening is in the bottom\n- Jhill's Roost - go deep inside and check for a missing floor\n\nmany thanks to Fluxmaster, without him, this mod would have failed.\n\nmod info can be found at: https://discord.gg/cYsQWejJ27\n\n",
	"changeNote": "bugfixes:\n- last piece of Cursewall\n- Dragonmouth warps\n- cosmetic fixes\nnew:\n- integration with the Underdark\n- more population\n- a stream in the north running through what many call 'meteor valley' into the waters of the Mounds of the Dead",
