	"description": "Total Conan Vanilla map rebuild:\n- many deserts turned into Savannah or even greener\n- The Nameless City is like an overgrown jungle city\n- Map will suggest this land is an Island\n- New areas: in the North East and in the South\n- New Asagarth has neutral populace (like in Supermeru)\n- Now with moving boats (like the Riverboats mod)\n- Designed to work with its sister project: the Underdark\n- Map with 267 regions to support conquest scenarios included\n- sun and moon rise in the east\n- admins: at X-292390.0  Y218820.0  Z-24050.0  you can find a hall to set up races and classes like so many servers do nowaydays.  Or you turn it into a small dungeon.\n- the combination of Underdark and the Isle of Tir-na-nOg will about double the playable area\n\nWARNING!  If you run this mod WITHOUT the Underdark-mod, then you will have to seal off the following holes:\n- Kings Niche - there is an opening all the way in the back\n- the Passage, coming from the jungle, the moment you come in the first great cave, turn left, opening is in the bottom\n\nWARNING 2.  Mod order.   Load ITN below ANY other mod that modifies the landscape. \nDevious Desires has to be loaded below ITN.\n\nmany thanks to Fluxmaster, without him, this mod would have failed.\n\nmore mod info, and there is a lot, can be found at: https://discord.gg/cYsQWejJ27\n\n\n\n",
	"changeNote": "2.0.2\ndid you know that Charon, before he became a ferryman at the river Styx, used the traverse the Lethe?\nSo much that people have forgotten... But then, if you know what the Lethe stands for in mythology, it is no wonder.\n\nAnway, Charon is here. He starts his trip at the Descent of Dagon. I took the trip... and it is so cool!\n\nalso, most servers are mentioning that they fall through the ships and that the ships are not moving, others mention that they start moving after a while, and THEN you can climb on them. In Single Player everything works fine. The technical term is that there seems to be a 'replication issue' (i.e. mismatch between where server says the boat is and the client). This release includes a different parameter setting affecting replication, which I can only test after releasing this version for a server. I am sorry for the inconvenience.\n\n",
